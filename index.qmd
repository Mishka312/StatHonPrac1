## Question 1

There are 2 methods to present the rows containing NA values. The first is to use the apply()  function across all rows of the airquality dataframe.
```{r}
# Method 1
airquality_na_ <- airquality[apply(is.na(airquality), 1, any), ]
head(airquality_na_)

```

The second method to get the same information is to use a for loop: 

```{r}

# Method 2
for (i in 1:nrow(airquality)) {
  if (sum(is.na(airquality[i, ])) > 0) {
    print(airquality[i, ])
  }
}

```
